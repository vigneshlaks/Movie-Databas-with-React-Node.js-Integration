  I like learning about the different technologies and familiarizing myself with them

# What you disliked and suggestions for improvement
feedback_disliked: |
  There were so many errors and bugs
  It was obvius the assignment was rushed
  Spent more time trying to debug problems that ultimately weren't entirely my fault than
  I did learning
  Very frustrating homework
  The TAs themselves didn't seem to be very knowledgable and had a poor time debugging
