# Movie Database Web App: React & Node.js Integration

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a web application for accessing a movie database. Unlike the previous assignment, where we built a basic client-server web app with DynamoDB integration, this project focuses on enhancing the user interface with React and integrating it with a Node.js backend.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code, known for its efficiency and scalability.

## Running the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install required dependencies.
2. **Launch the Backend**: Execute `npm run start-server` to start the Node.js backend.
3. **Launch the Frontend**: Run `npm run start-web` to launch the React frontend.

## Code Structure

- **Node.js Backend**: Contains `server.js` which initializes the web server and handles user search requests.
- **React Frontend**: Core logic in `App.js` manages search functionality and displays search results.
